# Machine-Learning-Hacktober
Hello Folks!
This is a machine learning and data analysis repository and is open to everyone for contributions

## Instructions
This repository is for the machine learning and data analysis projects. All the contributors can make a pull request by completing the questions provided in the repo(answer atleast 1 of the questions before making a pull request), or by adding any of the python files related to DATA ANALYSIS, MACHINE LEARNING and OPENCV or by editing and change the code written in the already provided files.

We've have provided some datasets for the beginners as well, they can work on any of them before making any pull request. 
P.S. if you have any other datasets with you, feel free to add it in the datasets folder.

Before moving any further, I am assuming that everyone is a bit familiar with python, github and knows how to use jupyter-notebook.

1) Fork the repository to your own github account by clicking on the button present on the repository page.
2) Clone the repository to your own systems by clicking on the clone button given which will provide you with a link, and using the command
   
   "git clone link_provided_on_the_repo_page"
3) Create a copy of the Questions_Folder and rename that copy as SolutionbyStudentname (write your name instead of the studentname), and now make changes or add answers to the questions provided inside the .ipynb files or add any machine learning,data analysis or opencv file of your own inside that solutionbystudentname folder only. 
P.s.-> Only make changes inside the folder you've created and no where else.
4) Add and commit the changes made on your system and then push the repository to your account, by using the command
  
   "git push origin master"

5) After all the changes are commited to your own personal github account, you'll get an option for the "New pull request", click on that option and make your pull request, and your work is Done...
